📦 Tier-3: The Data Backbone of AWS 3-Tier Architecture

Overview

This is the final tier in the AWS 3-Tier Architecture series, focusing on the Data Layer—engineered for high availability, durability, and scalability using Terraform and VS Code. The infrastructure is tightly integrated with the AWS Console and orchestrated through infrastructure-as-code principles.

🎯 Objectives

Provision and configure all data-related services using Terraform

Ensure fault tolerance and high availability (Multi-AZ)

Modularize for reusability and Git-based version control

Secure access with IAM, private subnets, and encryption

🧱 Key Infrastructure Components

1. Amazon RDS (MySQL)

Multi-AZ deployment

Primary and Secondary instances in private subnets

Linked via a dedicated Database Security Group

2. Amazon DynamoDB

Serverless NoSQL for rapid, scalable access to key-value and document data

3. Amazon S3

Durable storage for structured and unstructured data (snapshots, exports, backups)

4. Amazon Redshift

Analytics and business intelligence (BI) workloads

5. Amazon ElastiCache

In-memory caching for reduced latency in DB calls

6. IAM + Security Groups + VPC Private Subnets

Principle of least privilege enforced

Traffic control and network isolation for RDS and services

7. AWS Backup + DMS

Managed backups and data migration support

⚙️ Bonus Enhancements

Amazon Aurora, AWS Glue, Kinesis – for scalable and real-time workloads

Athena + Lake Formation – for querying and cataloging data lakes

Secrets Manager, WAF, Shield – for credential management and threat mitigation

🛠 Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform

🔁 Reusable and modularized configurations

📂 Version-controlled using GitHub

🔐 Implements state locking, IAM roles, and backup orchestration

Module Highlights

rds_mysql.tf

dynamodb.tf

s3.tf

redshift.tf

elasticache.tf

iam.tf

backup_dms.tf

All resources are parameterized and integrated into a shared Terraform state backend.
